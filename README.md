# Genetic Algorithm for Equitable Neighborhood Service

## About

This algorithm (GAENS) was developed to reroute transit routes using pre-existing bus routes through expansion and shrinking mutations based on an evolutionary algorithm. This project was designed and evaluated for CS3710 (Advanced Topics in AI: AI for Social Good) by Jacob Emmerson and Chris Hinson.
